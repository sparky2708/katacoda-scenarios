Let's edit the Dockerfile to what you would like your image to contain:

`emacs Dockerfile`{{execute}}

(ctrl-X-s saves, ctrl-X-c quits [prompts if needs to be saved)

NOTE: Emacs has some issues in Katacoda and sometimes when you exit from EMACS the command prompt starts to underline or some other strange behavior is observed. To fix that just reset the terminal attributes:

`reset`{{execute}}
