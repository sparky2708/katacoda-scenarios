First, let's pull the DOCKER image source code from github:

`git clone https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER}/docker-images.git`{{execute}}

`cd docker-images/${DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME} && ls`{{execute}}

Make sure that your DOCKER image source code appears as you had expected when you run the above statement.
